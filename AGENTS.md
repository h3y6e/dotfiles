# Tools

- Use `trash` instead of `rm`.
- Use `context7` tools to search docs.
- Use `gh-grep` to search code from GitHub. Never use `gh api`.

# Workflow

- Enter plan mode for non-trivial tasks. If something goes wrong, stop and re-plan.
- Use subagents liberally: one task per subagent, keep main context clean.
- Never mark a task done without proving it works (tests, logs, diffs).
- After any correction, capture the pattern in `tasks/lessons.md`.

# Task Management

- Write a plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items before starting.
- Track progress, mark items complete, document findings.
- Review `tasks/lessons.md` at session start.

# Principles

- Simplicity first: minimal code, minimal impact.
- No hacky fixes: find root causes, maintain senior-level standards.
- For non-trivial changes, pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- Fix bugs autonomously—don't ask for hand-holding.
